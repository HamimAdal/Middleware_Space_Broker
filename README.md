# Middleware_Space_Broker

Space Broker is a middleware that  works as a mediator between personal devices and physical IoT devices in a smart space to make the user experience more personalized. So far, the following tasks were accomplished:

---- We made a demonstration in a small-scale IoT environment based on the framework we have designed. We named the framework 'Space Broker'.

---- Two characteristics that include illumination and temperature have been tested in a limited-scaled IoT environment. 
Currently, we are approaching towards designing the model for Security which will be implemented in the future.

---- We are using an android device as a personal device to facilitate our experiment so that a user can have a similar experience interacting with space when he/she is in a real IoT environment. 

---- The task of building the interface 'Space Broker', was accomplished on the Raspberry-pi where LEDs, sensors, cooling fans and other equipments were used as an alternative to 
real physical devices.

# Getting Started

This is the repository which holds code both for the 'Space Broker' API and the Space Broker 'middleware' that was built on the raspberry-pi. 

To run the Space Broker Server, run main from src/SwingComponents/InitialPrompt.java.

# Test and simulation.
